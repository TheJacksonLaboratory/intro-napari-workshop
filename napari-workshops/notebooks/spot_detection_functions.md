# From workflow to widget: customizing napari

The napari application uses a backend for the graphical user interface (GUI) called [Qt](https://doc.qt.io). A key feature of this framework is the use of [widgets](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-index.html), which are composable, basic UI elements. napari not only utilizes these for its UI, but also enables you can add your own as `dockable` elements. In fact, the layer controls, layer list, and napari console are all such dockable containers of Qt widgets.

There are a number of ways to go about creating your own widgets, you can see [an in-depth overview in the napari documentation](https://napari.org/dev/howtos/extending/magicgui.html). By far the simplest is to rely on the fact that napari supports the use of [`magicgui`](https://pyapp-kit.github.io/magicgui/), a Python library for quick and easy building of GUIs. A key feature of `magicgui` is autogeneration of GUIs from functions and dataclasses, by mapping Python type hints to widgets.

In this module, we will implement elements of our previous workflow as functions and then use [`magicgui.magicgui`](https://pyapp-kit.github.io/magicgui/api/magicgui/#magicguimagicgui) decorator on those functions to return us compound widgets that we can use to make exploring the parameters easier in the GUI

Let's get everything set up, based on the previous notebook:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import io

nuclei_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-spot-detection-tutorial/main/data/nuclei_cropped.tif'
nuclei = io.imread(nuclei_url)

spots_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-spot-detection-tutorial/main/data/spots_cropped.tif'
spots = io.imread(spots_url)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import napari
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot

# create the napari viewer
viewer = napari.Viewer()

# add the nuclei image to the viewer
viewer.add_image(nuclei, colormap = 'I Forest', blending = 'minimum')

# add the spots image to the viewer
viewer.add_image(spots, colormap = 'I Orange', blending='minimum')
```

Now let's write a function that takes an array and a `sigma` value and performs the 
high-pass operation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

def gaussian_high_pass(image, sigma):
    low_pass = ndi.gaussian_filter(image, sigma)
    high_passed_im = (image - low_pass).clip(0)
    
    return high_passed_im
```

We can test our function, in similar fashion as before:

```{code-cell} ipython3
high_passed_spots = gaussian_high_pass(spots, 2)

viewer.add_image(high_passed_spots, colormap="I Blue", blending="minimum")
```

Now lets modify the function slightly, by providing type annotations and a docstring, to 
leverage napari `magicgui` integration.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from magicgui import magicgui

@magicgui
def gaussian_high_pass(image: "napari.types.ImageData", sigma: float = 2)->"napari.types.ImageData":
    """Apply a gaussian high pass filter to an image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        The image to be filtered.
    sigma : float
        The sigma (width) of the gaussian filter to be applied.
        The default value is 2.
    
    Returns
    -------
    high_passed_im : np.ndarray
        The image with the high pass filter applied
    """
    low_pass = ndi.gaussian_filter(image, sigma)
    high_passed_im = (image - low_pass).clip(0)
    
    return high_passed_im
```

We have our `magicgui` decorated function and we've annotated it with the napari types.
Now it is both a compound widget and a callable function. Let's add the widget to the
viewer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(gaussian_high_pass)
```

Hit the `Run` button and you will see that a new layer is added with the results of our
function! If you press it again, the data for that layer will be updated in place. So
you can change the `sigma` value and see the updated result.

```{tip}
Hover over the labels `image` and `sigma` -- the names of the parameters we passed to the function.
You should see tooltips with the docstring information! How cool is that?
```

Our function is also the widget, so we can get the value of the current setting:

```{code-cell} ipython3
gaussian_high_pass.sigma.value
```

Let's also check that the function is still working as expected -- type annotations are not
used by Python at runtime, so nothing should have changed.

```{code-cell} ipython3
test_output = gaussian_high_pass(spots, 2)
test_output.shape
```

This means that if you have a script or module you can import the function and use it as normally
or use it as a widget in napari.

Let's make the the widget more dynamic, by giving `magicgui` some extra information.
Let's ask for a slider for the `sigma` parameter and lets have the function be auto-called
when the slider is dragged.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@magicgui(auto_call=True,
            sigma={"widget_type": "FloatSlider", "min": 0, "max": 20}
         )
def gaussian_high_pass(image: "napari.types.ImageData", sigma: float = 2)->"napari.types.ImageData":
    """Apply a gaussian high pass filter to an image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        The image to be filtered.
    sigma : float
        The sigma (width) of the gaussian filter to be applied.
        The default value is 2.
    
    Returns
    -------
    high_passed_im : np.ndarray
        The image with the high pass filter applied
    """
    low_pass = ndi.gaussian_filter(image, sigma)
    high_passed_im = (image - low_pass).clip(0)
    
    return high_passed_im
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(gaussian_high_pass)
```

Now you can play with the slider until you get the effect you want in the GUI and then return the value:

```{code-cell} ipython3
gaussian_high_pass.sigma.value
```

Or you can *set the value*:

```{code-cell} ipython3
gaussian_high_pass.sigma.value = 5
```

Finally, lets make a widget for the whole workflow as a function. Now we are starting with
image layer data, but then we want a Points layer with points. So we will return a LayerDataTuple.
If `detect_spots()` returns a `LayerDataTuple`, napari will add a *new layer* to
   the viewer using the data in the `LayerDataTuple`. For more information on
   the `LayerDataTuple` type, please see
   [the docs](https://napari.org/plugins/guides.html#the-layerdata-tuple).
    - The layer data tuple should be: `(layer_data, layer_metadata, layer_type)`
    - `layer_data`: the data to be displayed in the new layer (i.e., the points
      coordinates)
    - `layer_metadata`: the display options for the layer stored as a
      dictionary. Some options to consider: `symbol`, `size`, `face_color`
    - `layer_type`: the name of the layer type as a stringâ€”in this case `'Points'`

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from skimage.feature import blob_log

@magicgui
def detect_spots(
    image: "napari.types.ImageData",
    high_pass_sigma: float = 2,
    spot_threshold: float = 0.01,
    blob_sigma: float = 2
)->"napari.types.LayerDataTuple":
    """Apply a gaussian high pass filter to an image.

        The default value is 0.01.

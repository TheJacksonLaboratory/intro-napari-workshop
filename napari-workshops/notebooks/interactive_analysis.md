# Interactive analysis with napari
One need for bioimage analysts is to interactively perform analysis on images. This interaction could be manual parameter tuning, such as adjusting thresholds, or performing human-in-the-loop analysis through clicking on specific regions of an image.

**[napari](https://napari.org/)** makes such interactive analyses easy because of it's easy coupling with Python and Scientific Python ecosystem, including tools like **[numpy](https://numpy.org/)** and **[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)**.

## Setup

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-output]

# this cell is required to run these notebooks on Binder. Make sure that you also have a desktop tab open.
import os
if 'BINDER_SERVICE_HOST' in os.environ:
    os.environ['DISPLAY'] = ':1.0'
```

As previously, we start by importing `napari`, our `nbscreenshot` utility, and instantiating an empty viewer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import napari
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot

# Create an empty viewer
viewer = napari.Viewer()
```

Let's read the same `cells3d` image from previous lessons, take a maximum projection, and view it in napari:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage.data import cells3d

image_data = cells3d()  # shape (60, 2, 256, 256)

membranes = image_data[:, 0, :, :]
nuclei = image_data[:, 1, :, :]

viewer.add_image(nuclei, colormap="green")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Segmentation workflow
Let's develop a segmentation workflow for the nuclei using processing utilities from scikit-image.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import feature
from skimage import filters
from skimage import measure
from skimage import morphology
from skimage import segmentation
from scipy import ndimage
import numpy as np
```

First let's try and separate background from foreground using a threshold. Here we'll use an 
automatically calculated threshold. However, we can see that the image has some noise so lets 
apply a gaussian blur to smooth it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
blur = filters.gaussian(nuclei, sigma=10, preserve_range=True)
viewer.add_image(blur)
foreground = nuclei >= filters.threshold_li(blur)
viewer.add_labels(foreground, name='foreground')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

Notice that there is still some signal from outside the nuclei and some of the holes located 
inside the nuclei. We can use some morphological operators to clean this up. First we will do an
opening operation, which will first erode the image and then dilate it. Then, we will fill the 
holes using a hole filling algorithm and then remove any small objects. 

```{tip}
We could update the layer data in the viewer *in place* if we didn't want to create another 
object or another layer.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
foreground_processed = morphology.binary_opening(foreground)
foreground_processed = morphology.remove_small_holes(foreground_processed, area_threshold = 20**3)
foreground_processed = morphology.remove_small_objects(foreground_processed, min_size=20**3)    
viewer.add_labels(foreground_processed)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We will now convert this binary mask into an **instance segmentation** where each nuclei is assigned a unique label by using connected-components labeling.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import measure

labels = measure.label(foreground_processed)

viewer.add_labels(
    labels,
    opacity=0.5,
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

As you can see, we have all the objects labeled, but touching objects are not separated. To do this, 
we can use a **marker controlled watershed** approach. 

```{tip}
You could place the markers manually in napari instead of computing the locations.
```

The first step in this procedure is to calculate a distance transform on the binary mask as follows.

```{code-cell} ipython3
distance = ndimage.distance_transform_edt(foreground_processed)
viewer.add_image(distance)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We'll actually want to smooth the distance transform to avoid over segmentation artifacts. 
We can do this on the data in the viewer, in place.

```{code-cell} ipython3
smoothed_distance = filters.gaussian(distance, 5)
viewer.layers['distance'].data = smoothed_distance
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

Now we can try and identify the centers of each of the nuclei by finding peaks of the smoothed distance transform.

```{code-cell} ipython3
peak_local_max = feature.peak_local_max(
    smoothed_distance,
    min_distance=10,
    exclude_border=False
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.add_points(peak_local_max, name='peaks', size=5, face_color='red', blending='translucent_no_depth')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We can now remove any of the points that don't correspond to nuclei centers or add any new ones using 
the GUI Points layer tools. Or we could select a point using the GUI tools, but remove it 
programmaticallyâ€”or some combination of both.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# uncomment these lines to remove a point programmatically
#viewer.layers['peaks'].selected_data = {5}
#viewer.layers['peaks'].remove_selected()
```

Using the markers we can now seed the watershed algorithm which will find the nuclei boundaries.
However, we do need to convert the coordinates into a mask first.

```{note}
We'll use the Points layer data, because we may have added or removed a point!
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
seeds = np.zeros(nuclei.shape, dtype=bool)
seeds[tuple(np.round(viewer.layers['peaks'].data).astype(int).T)] = 1

markers = measure.label(seeds)
nuclei_segmentation = segmentation.watershed(
    -smoothed_distance, 
    markers, 
    mask=foreground_processed
)

viewer.add_labels(nuclei_segmentation)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We can now save our segmentation programmatically using our builtin save method.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# uncomment this line to save the segmentation to a tif file
#viewer.layers['nuclei_segmentation'].save('nuclei-automated-segmentation.tif', plugin='builtins')
```

## Interactive thresholding with a custom GUI element

Interactivity can be greatly enhanced by custom GUI elements like slides and push buttons, custom mouse functions, or custom keybindings. **[napari](https://napari.org/)** can easliy be exteneded with these features, and a companion library **[magicgui](https://magicgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** maintained by the napari team allows users to make extensions to the GUI without having to write any GUI code.

We'll now explore adding such interactivty to **napari**.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Remove all processed layers
for l in viewer.layers[1:]:
    viewer.layers.remove(l)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Import magicgui
from magicgui import magicgui
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from napari.types import ImageData, LabelsData

@magicgui(auto_call=True,
          percentile={"widget_type": "IntSlider", "min": 0, "max": 100})
def threshold(image: ImageData, percentile: int = 50) -> LabelsData:
    data_min = np.min(image)
    data_max = np.max(image)
    return image > data_min + percentile / 100 * (data_max - data_min)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(threshold, area="right")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Adding a custom key binding to the viewer for processing foreground data

```{code-cell} ipython3
@viewer.bind_key('Shift-P')
def process_foreground(viewer):
    data = viewer.layers['threshold result'].data
    data_processed = morphology.remove_small_holes(data, 60)
    data_processed = morphology.remove_small_objects(data_processed, min_size=50)
    viewer.layers['threshold result'].data = data_processed
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

process_foreground(viewer)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Add an empty labels layer with the same shape as our maximum intensity projection
viewer.add_labels(np.zeros(nuclei.shape, dtype=int), name='nuclei segmentation')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Bind another keybinding to complete segmentation
@viewer.bind_key('Shift-S')
def complete_segmentation(viewer):
    foreground = viewer.layers['threshold result'].data
    distance = ndimage.distance_transform_edt(foreground)
    smoothed_distance = filters.gaussian(distance, 10)
    peaks = feature.peak_local_max(
        distance,
        min_distance=12
    )
    peaks = np.round(peaks).astype(int).T
    seeds = np.zeros(smoothed_distance.shape, dtype=bool)
    seeds[(peaks[0], peaks[1])] = 1

    markers = measure.label(seeds)
    nuclei_segmentation = segmentation.watershed(
        -smoothed_distance, 
        markers, 
        mask=foreground
    )
    viewer.layers['nuclei segmentation'].data = nuclei_segmentation
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

image_data = viewer.layers['nuclei'].data
thresholded = image_data > image_data.min() + 12 / 100 * (image_data.max() - image_data.min())
viewer.layers['threshold result'].data = thresholded
process_foreground(viewer)
complete_segmentation(viewer)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Conclusions

We've now seen how to interactively perform analyses by adding data to the napari viewer, and editing it as we moved through an analysis workflow. We've also seen how to extend the viewer with custom GUI functionality and keybindings, making analyses even more interactive!

# Interactive analysis with napari
One need for bioimage analysts is to interactively perform analysis on images. This interaction could be manual parameter tuning, such as adjusting thresholds, or performing human-in-the-loop analysis through clicking on specific regions of an image.

**[napari](https://napari.org/)** makes such interactive analyses easy because of it's easy coupling with Python and Scientific Python ecosystem, including tools like **[numpy](https://numpy.org/)** and **[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)**.

## Setup

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-output]

# this cell is required to run these notebooks on Binder. Make sure that you also have a desktop tab open.
import os
if 'BINDER_SERVICE_HOST' in os.environ:
    os.environ['DISPLAY'] = ':1.0'
```

As previously, we start by importing `napari`, our `nbscreenshot` utility, and instantiating an empty viewer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import napari
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot

# Create an empty viewer
viewer = napari.Viewer()
```

Let's read the same `cells3d` image from previous lessons, take a maximum projection, and view it in napari:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage.data import cells3d

image_data = cells3d()  # shape (60, 2, 256, 256)

membranes = image_data[:, 0, :, :]
nuclei = image_data[:, 1, :, :]
nuclei_mip = nuclei.max(axis=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.add_image(nuclei_mip)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Visualizing image filtering results

One common task in image processing in **image filtering** which can be used to denoise an image or detect edges or other features.

We can use **napari** to visualize the results of some of the image filters that come with the **scikit-image** library.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import filters
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.add_image(filters.sobel_h(nuclei_mip), name='Horizontal Sobel')
viewer.add_image(filters.sobel_v(nuclei_mip), name='Vertical Sobel')
viewer.add_image(filters.roberts(nuclei_mip), name='Roberts')
viewer.add_image(filters.prewitt(nuclei_mip), name='Prewitt')
viewer.add_image(filters.scharr(nuclei_mip), name='Scharr')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

Toggle the visibility on and off in the layer list to see the different effects of the filters.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Remove all filter layers
for l in viewer.layers[1:]:
    viewer.layers.remove(l)
```

## Interactive segmentation
Let's now perform an interactive segmentation of the nuclei using processing utilities from scikit-image.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import morphology
from skimage import feature
from skimage import measure
from skimage import segmentation
from scipy import ndimage
import numpy as np
```

First let's try and separate background from foreground using a threshold. Here we'll use an automatically calculated threshold.

```{code-cell} ipython3
foreground = nuclei_mip >= filters.threshold_li(nuclei_mip)
viewer.add_labels(foreground, name='foreground')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

Notice the debris located outside the nuclei and some of the holes located inside the nuclei. We will remove the debris by 
filtering out small objects, and fill the holes using a hole filling algorithm. Note that we can update the layer data in the 
viewer *in place* if we don't want to create another object or another layer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
foreground_processed = morphology.remove_small_holes(foreground, 60)
foreground_processed = morphology.remove_small_objects(foreground_processed, min_size=50)

viewer.layers['foreground'].data = foreground_processed
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We will now convert this binary mask into an **instance segmentation** where each nuclei is assigned a unique label.

We will do this using a **marker controlled watershed** approach. The first step in this procedure is to calculate a 
distance transform on the binary mask as follows.

```{code-cell} ipython3
distance = ndimage.distance_transform_edt(foreground_processed)
viewer.add_image(distance)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We'll actually want to smooth the distance transform to avoid over segmentation artifacts. We can do this on the data in the viewer in place.

```{code-cell} ipython3
smoothed_distance = filters.gaussian(distance, 10)
viewer.layers['distance'].data = smoothed_distance
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

Now we can try and identify the centers of each of the nuclei by finding peaks of the smoothed distance transform.

```{code-cell} ipython3
peak_local_max = feature.peak_local_max(
    smoothed_distance,
    min_distance=12
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.add_points(peak_local_max, name='peaks', size=5, face_color='red')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We can now remove any of the points that don't correspond to nuclei centers or add any new ones using the GUI Points
layer tools. Or we could select a point using the GUI tools, but remove it programmaticallyâ€”or some combination of both.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# uncomment these lines to remove points
#viewer.layers['peaks'].selected_data = {5}
#viewer.layers['peaks'].remove_selected()
```

Based on those peaks we can now seed the watershed algorithm which will find the nuclei boundaries.

```{code-cell} ipython3
new_peaks = np.round(viewer.layers['peaks'].data).astype(int).T
seeds = np.zeros(nuclei_mip.shape, dtype=bool)
seeds[(new_peaks[0], new_peaks[1])] = 1

markers = measure.label(seeds)
nuclei_segmentation = segmentation.watershed(
    -smoothed_distance, 
    markers, 
    mask=foreground_processed
)

viewer.add_labels(nuclei_segmentation)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

We can now save our segmentation programmatically using our builtin save method.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# uncomment this line to save the segmentation to a tif file
#viewer.layers['nuclei_segmentation'].save('nuclei-automated-segmentation.tif', plugin='builtins')
```

## Interactive thresholding with a custom GUI element

Interactivity can be greatly enhanced by custom GUI elements like slides and push buttons, custom mouse functions, or custom keybindings. **[napari](https://napari.org/)** can easliy be exteneded with these features, and a companion library **[magicgui](https://magicgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** maintained by the napari team allows users to make extensions to the GUI without having to write any GUI code.

We'll now explore adding such interactivty to **napari**.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Remove all processed layers
for l in viewer.layers[1:]:
    viewer.layers.remove(l)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Import magicgui
from magicgui import magicgui
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from napari.types import ImageData, LabelsData

@magicgui(auto_call=True,
          percentile={"widget_type": "IntSlider", "min": 0, "max": 100})
def threshold(image: ImageData, percentile: int = 50) -> LabelsData:
    data_min = np.min(image)
    data_max = np.max(image)
    return image > data_min + percentile / 100 * (data_max - data_min)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(threshold, area="right")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Adding a custom key binding to the viewer for processing foreground data

```{code-cell} ipython3
@viewer.bind_key('Shift-P')
def process_foreground(viewer):
    data = viewer.layers['threshold result'].data
    data_processed = morphology.remove_small_holes(data, 60)
    data_processed = morphology.remove_small_objects(data_processed, min_size=50)
    viewer.layers['threshold result'].data = data_processed
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

process_foreground(viewer)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Add an empty labels layer with the same shape as our maximum intensity projection
viewer.add_labels(np.zeros(nuclei_mip.shape, dtype=int), name='nuclei segmentation')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Bind another keybinding to complete segmentation
@viewer.bind_key('Shift-S')
def complete_segmentation(viewer):
    foreground = viewer.layers['threshold result'].data
    distance = ndimage.distance_transform_edt(foreground)
    smoothed_distance = filters.gaussian(distance, 10)
    peaks = feature.peak_local_max(
        distance,
        min_distance=12
    )
    peaks = np.round(peaks).astype(int).T
    seeds = np.zeros(smoothed_distance.shape, dtype=bool)
    seeds[(peaks[0], peaks[1])] = 1

    markers = measure.label(seeds)
    nuclei_segmentation = segmentation.watershed(
        -smoothed_distance, 
        markers, 
        mask=foreground
    )
    viewer.layers['nuclei segmentation'].data = nuclei_segmentation
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

image_data = viewer.layers['nuclei_mip'].data
thresholded = image_data > image_data.min() + 12 / 100 * (image_data.max() - image_data.min())
viewer.layers['threshold result'].data = thresholded
process_foreground(viewer)
complete_segmentation(viewer)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Conclusions

We've now seen how to interactively perform analyses by adding data to the napari viewer, and editing it as we moved through an analysis workflow. We've also seen how to extend the viewer with custom GUI functionality and keybindings, making analyses even more interactive!

# Notebooks

```{important}
In this repository, all notebooks have been converted to MyST Markdown files
(with a `.md` extension), because this format is easier to visualize on GitHub.
This also makes it easier to view differences between versions of the notebooks
on the GitHub interface.  
To run these notebooks locally, please see the instructions [here](../notebook_setup.md)
```

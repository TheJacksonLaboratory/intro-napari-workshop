# Exploratory analysis: spot detection

## Overview
In this activity, we will perform spot detection on some in situ sequencing data
([Feldman and Singh et al., Cell, 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31067-0s)).
In doing so, we will combine methods from [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and
[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/). The goal is to familiarize you with
performing analysis that integrates the scientific python ecosystem and napari.

## Data source

The data were downloaded from the
[OpticalPooledScreens github repository](https://github.com/feldman4/OpticalPooledScreens).

## Next steps

Following this activity, we will use the workflow generated in this activity to
create a napari spot detection widget or even plugin.

## `binder` setup
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-output]
# this cell is required to run these notebooks on Binder. Make sure that you also have a desktop tab open.
import os
if 'BINDER_SERVICE_HOST' in os.environ:
    os.environ['DISPLAY'] = ':1.0'
```

## Screenshots
As previously, we will use the `nbscreenshot` to document our work in the notebook as we go along.
As a reminder, the usage is: 

```Python
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Load the data

In the cells below load the data using the scikit-image `imread()` function. For
more information about the `imread()` function, please see the [scikit-image docs](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.io.html#skimage.io.imread). We are loading two images:

- `nuclei`: an image of cell nuclei
- `spots`: an image of in situ sequencing spots

```{code-cell} python
from skimage import io

nuclei_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-spot-detection-tutorial/main/data/nuclei_cropped.tif'
nuclei = io.imread(nuclei_url)

spots_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-spot-detection-tutorial/main/data/spots_cropped.tif'
spots = io.imread(spots_url)
```

## View the data

To view our data, we will create a napari viewer and then we will add the images to the viewer
via the viewer's `add_image()` method. We will also import the `nbscreenshot` utility.

```{code-cell} python
import napari
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot

# create the napari viewer
viewer = napari.Viewer()

# add the nuclei image to the viewer
viewer.add_image(nuclei, colormap='green')

# add the spots image to the viewer
viewer.add_image(spots, colormap='magenta', blending='additive')
```

After loading the data, inspect it in the viewer and adjust the
layer settings to your liking (e.g., contrast limits, colormap). 
You can pan/zoom around the image by click/dragging to pan and scrolling with your
mousewheel or trackpad to zoom.

```{tip}
You can adjust a layer's opacity to see the change how much you see of the
layers that are "under" it.
```
For example, for better contrast you could choose an inverted colormap and minimum blending.

```{code-cell} python
viewer.layers['nuclei'].colormap = 'I Forest'
viewer.layers['nuclei'].blending = 'minimum'
viewer.layers['spots'].colormap = 'I Orange'
viewer.layers['spots'].blending = 'minimum'
```

Once you are satisfied, you can print the output of any manual changes and then take a screenshot of the viewer.

```{code-cell} python
# example of printing the nuclei layer visualization params
print('Colormap: ', viewer.layers['nuclei'].colormap.name)
print('Contrast limits: ', viewer.layers['nuclei'].contrast_limits)
print('Opacity: ', viewer.layers['nuclei'].opacity)
print('Blending: ', viewer.layers['nuclei'].blending)
```

```{code-cell} python
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Create an image filter

If you look carefull at the `spots` layer, you will notice that it contains background and
autofluorescence from the cells. It may help to just look at the single channel.

```{code-cell} python
viewer.layers['nuclei'].visible = False
```

To improve spot detection, we will apply a high pass filter to improve the contrast of the spots.

A simple way to achieve this is to:
1. blur the image with a Gaussian, which removes high-frequency informationâ€”this is why we use it for denoising.
2. subtract the blurred image from the original.

Lets try this using the `gaussian_filter` from `scipy` with a sigma of 2 px and lets clip any negative values:

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as ndi


low_pass = ndi.gaussian_filter(spots, 2)
high_passed_spots = (spots - low_pass).clip(0)   
```

Let's visualize both versions of the data.

```{code-cell} python
viewer.add_image(low_pass, colormap="I Forest", blending="minimum")
viewer.add_image(high_passed_spots, colormap="I Blue", blending="minimum")
```

Toggle the visibility of the 3 spots layers to get a better sense of the effect of our filter.
Let's hide the `low_pass` and take a screenshot for documentation.


```{code-cell} python
viewer.layers['low_pass'].visible = False

nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Detect spots

Next, we will use one of the blob detection algorithms from sci-kit image to
perform the blob detection.

```{tip}
- See the [blob detection tutorial from scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html). We recommend the [blob_log detector](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_log), but feel free to experiment!
- See the "Note" from the blob_log docs: "The radius of each blob is approximately $\sqrt{2}\sigma$ for a 2-D image"
```

```{code-cell} python
from skimage.feature import blob_log

# detect the spots on the filtered image
blobs_log = blob_log(
    high_passed_spots,
    max_sigma=3,
    threshold=None, # use a relative threshold instead
    threshold_rel=0.2
)
    
# convert the output of the blob detector to the 
# desired points_coords and sizes arrays
# (see the docstring for details)
spot_coords = blobs_log[:, 0:2]
spot_sizes = 2 * np.sqrt(2) * blobs_log[:, 2]
```

To visualize the results, add the spots to the viewer as a
[Points layer](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/points.html). If you
would like to see an example of using a points layer, see
[this example](https://napari.org/gallery/add_points.html).

```{code-cell} python
# add the detected spots to the viewer as a Points layer
viewer.add_points(spot_coords, size=spot_sizes)
```

```{code-cell} python
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

## Conclusion
In this activity, we have developed done the exploratory analysis for spot detection
using a combination of Jupyter notebook, scipy, scikit-image, and napari. In the
next activity, we will convert this workflow into a spot detection function to make 
it easier to explore the effect of parameters. Then, we will turn that into a napari widget
using `magicgui`.
